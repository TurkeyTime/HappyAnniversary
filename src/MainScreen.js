        <p>Ally and I kissed! It was amazing! We were hugging for what felt like forever and massaging each other and holding hands and suddenly it just happened!!! It did happen! It‚Äôs real. Weird to see her true feelings. I may be pursuing this further. Thank you God for answering my prayers.</p>

            screw it up. I care about her too much. Relax. Nothing has to be different. It‚Äôs so weird to think about. This changes everything. 
            At least we‚Äôll be together through the changes. I just took a walk down to the river under my bridge spot just to think. 
            So many emotions and so much happiness!

            I think I‚Äôm in love with this girl. Nobody else has made me feel this good just from texting or talking. 
            I brought her dining hall food last night after it closed and I know she loved the thought even though the food sucked. 
            Reading the morning after what she saved in chat sends some kinda feeling through my chest. I‚Äôm winning.</p>

The next night was equally pleasurable even though we just watched himym and fell asleep holding each other. Honestly I may have preferred that. I just want to hold you forever and feel your touch and look down at your adorable eyes peeking back up at me. You are my highlight of this semester babe. ;) oh yeah I started planning our ‚Äúfirst date‚Äù and when I sent you a sushi menu you said it was too expensiveüíÄ. 
            You are a keeper and I never want to lose you. That being said you‚Äôre

        <p>Hey :D we did our arboretum date and excelsior date. I honestly liked them both equally. 
            Just shows how putting a lot of effort and planning into a date could be just as enjoyable 
            as throwing something together with you. I love you. You make me feel so warm. When u slept 
            over at my house and wanted me to come back down to sleep with you my heart melted. I just 
            wanted to hold you and make you feel better through the emotions. I hope you‚Äôre never scared 
            to ask me to do these things. As a first date it felt kinda weird because we don‚Äôt have to get 
            to know each other anymore. Just enjoy each others company. It‚Äôs really great. I‚Äôm looking forward 
            to all the things I‚Äôll get to do with you.. thank you ally for being so great. Making ur own sacrifices 
            in driving so far every time. Paying for my ice cream =). Small things like that where u try to do stuff 
            for me makes all the difference. Life is better with you &lt;3</p>

            it was weird to talk about but I greatly appreciate you telling me. I was pleasantly surprised that nothing much happened 
            even though all that was before us. It‚Äôs nice to put it behind me even though I really have no right to be weirded out by it. 
            I‚Äôm just excited we get to share all our firsts together :)! Takes away a lot of the pressure. First dates, first holidays

        <p> Hey ally I love you. Our weekend was so awesome so far. 
            You left this morning after 3 days in a row of seeing each other! You got to 
            stay over 2 nights in a row!! That was amazing. I want to wake up next to you every morning. 
            We did MOA yesterday and got the cute lego rose. I can‚Äôt express to you how that makes me feel. 
            Going on a DATE and doing LEGOS? I love you so much I can‚Äôt take it. I didn‚Äôt know dating could
             be this fun. Us sharing nerdy things is crazy to me. Thanks for taking time to all the lingerie 
             stores I was very comfortable and not awkward. I love the random awkward stuff we do. Like in the
              car when when we kissed, a car of girls just screamed. So funny to me. The horror movie 
              that we almost fell asleep to. So boring. The fun night we shared though. Was very good. And I could 
              tell you felt the same. Everything I do with you is absolutely amazing. Just knowing how much you love 
              me and that this is mutual is crazy to me. I never want to leave you and it‚Äôs heartening to know you feel 
              the same way. I hope you treasure the rose. My room is slowly filling up with memories of us :D. We‚Äôll 
              have to go to the beach another time. It was rainy. Farmers market still tomorrow! That‚Äôs gonna be 4 days
               in a row of seeing each other!!! That‚Äôs so so so good. Shopping with you is so fun. I can‚Äôt tell you how
                weird it is to hear you want to go in a toy store lol. I always get made fun of for that with my family 
                and friends. I guess we get each other. I love you. I love you so much. </p>

            around together. It was so hot and bright outside. Such a fun experience with you. There‚Äôs no one I would rather 
            do mundane things like this with. Not that it was mundane but it‚Äôs just a good relationship thing to do and I enjoyed
             it a lot. And you‚Äôre so like me. You fixate on the same booths I would. Enjoy similar stuff. Not caught by all the flashy
              things. You seemed to enjoy looking at rocks More than any of the clothes or flowers! Wow. My rock girl. Mineral gal. 
              Haha. We shared snow cone and cheese curds and just walked around taking it all in. Then went back to ur place and got comfy :). Solid day.</p>

             stuff we have to do another time cause of weather but that makes me excited to come back. I love the 
             vibe of your family and I hope I can grow more comfortable. I loved the activities we did. We went to canal 
             park! The aquarium! Dressed up to dinner! Grad party for Reese! Ice cream and shops! So many shops! Mini golf!
              The mall! Am I forgetting anything? It was a packed weekend and by far my best days spent with you. I would live
               it over and over again if I could. It‚Äôs hard to spend these like 4 days away from you now. I miss you. Holding 
               you. The camping trip is coming up and I know it‚Äôs what you want and what I want but it‚Äôs gonna be hard to not 
               be as affectionate. I love you.</p>

            You were a little gwumpy at Afton but there was some stuff going through your mind so it‚Äôs okay. 
            It was fun to see you happy through the rest of it. I know you missed everyone so much and the apartment 
            can get lonely. I do wish there were more people to see here so you didn‚Äôt get sick of me. I hope you 
            still get excited about doing fun stuff alone with just me. I‚Äôm not so sure that you‚Äôll want to when 
            school starts in the fall but I really hope you will. I love you and want you to be happy. I will 
            support you even if it gets tough but I want you to let me in. </p>

        <p>Hey ally. The como pool yesterday was one of the best times I‚Äôve had with you in a bit. If felt so good after the uncertainty 
            of our overthinking and our talks. Ally I am honestly willing to stick with you through probably any challenges and I wish 
            you wouldn‚Äôt worry about losing me. I don‚Äôt know if you realize how much our relationship means to me too. Hell even our
             friendship. You‚Äôre right. We should talk more. The disconnect we feel has a solution but I wish you would let me in. It‚Äôs
              not like there isn‚Äôt patterns. It‚Äôs always after we‚Äôre in a group of people and a distance grows. i hope that gets better.
               We are so happy together. How we just held each other in the pool like cringy couples. 
              The lazy River. I want us to remember the drive when we just talked. And when we ate food. And watched zombie land? Hah.
               It feels like you‚Äôre the best thing that‚Äôs happened to me in quite a while and I do not want it going away anytime soon.</p>

        <p>Oh my gosh you are amazing once again. You made me cards for the 3 month. And got me a book we can read together! 
            About DRAGONS!!! It was a couple weeks late but it was worth it. Your words in the card made me melt. Literally. 
            Ugh I have such strong feelings for you. So much love. I‚Äôm so glad things feel good right now. We went to excelsior
             again and Maynard‚Äôs and walked by the water as we watched the sunset. It was beautiful. You wore a white dress with 
             flowers. It was beautiful. You really are something else. It‚Äôs hard to control myself sometimes. I feel so proud 
             walking down the street holding your hand. Sitting on the bench with you watching the pink sky fade to purple, 
             and then dark blue is heaven. In the morning we walked to the park and I loved that too. You were extra touchy 
             the whole two days. Lots of hand holding, kisses, nudges and whatnot. Makes me feel warm. You make me feel warm. I
              don‚Äôt want to wait a week to see you again. But I feel stronger than ever.</p>

        <p>I love you. This is one of the last dates of the summer. We went to the golf driving range and I taught u 
            sum stuff. You‚Äôre not amazing lol sorry but you‚Äôll hopefully be better by the time you read this!! We 
            went and got Dairy Queen and bought some clothes at target. You‚Äôre so cute omg ally. I‚Äôm sorry I 
            tickle you so much but it‚Äôs the most adorable thing ever. Maybe if you weren‚Äôt so cute I wouldn‚Äôt 
            torture you :)). It‚Äôs out of love &lt;3</p>

        <p>Hey you. Summer is over. Next time I see you will be on campus‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs sad Ally. 
            Best summer of my life. It was because of you. I‚Äôve done so many fun things and experienced 
            new things with you I never would have. Seriously I mean the arb, pools/beaches, hiking, movies, restaurants, zoo,
             blankets, long talks . . . So lucky I got to spend it with you. I really really hope that things don‚Äôt change Ally.
              Obviously they will have to a little bit but to grow distant from you would be a slow torture. I‚Äôm keeping you 
              close and I hope you do the same. I‚Äôm excited to date in the fall and winter even though I know it‚Äôll be a lot less. 
              Your happiness and success matters a lot to me and I hope I can help you manage that. Thanks for the great summer &lt;3. I love you.</p>

        <p>Well guess I‚Äôve been a bit busy the last few weeks. You have too. You‚Äôre making an effort and I can see that a bit better.
             It‚Äôs just so hard. I miss you so much. Just having hours of the day to ourselves. I‚Äôm already so nostalgic for the summer 
             dates of just doing nothing together for even DAYS. I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôll always love you Ally. With any relationship 
             there‚Äôs ups and downs. But with you, it always comes back up and it absolutely makes it worth it. It was rainy out 
             and we were tired today so we cuddled in your bed for a bit before doing homework. 
             Damn I wish you were here rn. Staying strong Al. Staying patient. You‚Äôre worth it. </p>

        <p>Hey als. We went on an impromptu date yesterday to noodles and co, went to guitar center, then grocery shopping together. 
            It was very good. We were in good moods. Later that night I made grilled chicken and we all played Mario kart. You were 
            comfortable and leaned against me. You let me put my arm around you and it was so warm and comfy. I don‚Äôt know if you 
            realize what that means to me, but I melt whenever u do thatüôÉ. It was a fun day with you as is any day that I see you. Hah</p>

        <p>Hey girl hah. I know it‚Äôs been a while since that last entry but I feel like that‚Äôs only cause we‚Äôve settled into such 
            a comfortable rhythm. Things feel really really good. After going through a tough change last fall I think we are
             stronger than ever. A power couple if you will. I would do anything for you. Sorry if there‚Äôs not many more regular entries 
             but that‚Äôs kinda just cause I figured it was stupid to keep thoguhts like this. I would rather tell you how beautiful 
             you are and how good you make me feel and have you know how much I treasure and appreciate you rather than keep it in my notes app! I love you. 
             We had a very fun winter together. There was like a whole 5 days we stayed together and did xmas lights at the arb, visited duluth, hung out in chan and cooked home meals!</p>

        <p>Hey bud. We had Valentine‚Äôs Day yesterday. Our first one ever:). It was amazing. I loved seeing you all dressed up 
            in your beautiful dress and makeup carrying the roses I got you. I feel so lucky and I‚Äôm happy every time I get a 
            chance to make you feel special. We went to the Oceanaire and the food was so tasty :). Made chocolate covered 
            strawberries back at Keeler. Had a fun night. I think I‚Äôve decided what I want to do with these notes and I 
            guess you‚Äôll know too if you‚Äôre reading this ;). Things have felt amazing. I don‚Äôt like being apart from you 
            and it‚Äôs nice to be able to make time for each other more often now. I loved your gifts for vday ally.. the 
            baymax, the chain. Your card was the best one you‚Äôve ever written. I re read it today and shit had me BLUSHING. 
            You‚Äôre a great girlfriend Ally. You make me happy and satisfied. </p>

             So worth it though. We made a steak and watched himym and wonka while sipping our sugar cookie mixed drinks. So amazing. 
             Just us two alone in the apartment. Then you stayed the whole next day too and the night. Makin breakfast together and 
             just doin hw. I love you so much. My favorite part was us awkwardly slow dancing in the kitchen lol. So intimate. 
             I really missed you bud. And that was just a week. Ugh. Move in with me fr üòµ‚Äçüí´ jk kinda anyways love you.</p>

        <p>Hello bub happy easter!!! You came home and we had some nice meals and colored eggs and did a bit of hw in the basement. 
            It was a very fun day and you looked absolutely beautiful head to toe.. the perfectly curled hair, makeup, fancy earrings, your EYES! 
            Fuzzy white sweater and boots‚Ä¶ ugh you are too much. My mom got u an Easter basket. It feels natural to have you in the family 
            and honestly it makes it easier for me to interact with them too. I think you‚Äôre very healthy for me and I hope I am for you too.
             You were a lil goofy guy tonight lmao you need to get some sleep I think but I‚Äôm glad you come over so often. 
             Could never see enough of you tbh. I love you ‚ù§Ô∏è.</p>
